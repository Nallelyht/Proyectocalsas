			<h2>POPOCATEPETL</h2>
			<p>
				One of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes today is Popocatépetl,
				nicknamed "the Popo" or "Don goyo" . The volcano is the second highest mountain in Mexico.
				Popocatépetl is the Aztec word for "Smoking Mountain". Popocatépetl was an Aztec warrior who
				loved Iztaccíhuatl. Iztaccíhuatl's father sent Popocatepetl to war in Oaxaca. He promised him
				his daughter as his wife if he returned (which Iztaccíhuatl's father thought he would not).
				Iztaccíhuatl's father told her that her lover had died in battle. She died of sadness.
				When Popocatépetl returned, and found out about the death of his lover, he killed himself
				by stabbing a knife into his heart. The gods covered them with snow and changed them into
				mountains. Iztaccíhuatl's mountain was called "La Mujer Dormida, (the "Sleeping Woman"),
				because it looks like a woman sleeping on her back. Popocatépetl became the volcano Popocatépetl,
				raining fire on Earth in anger at the loss of his lover.

				is portrayed in all mediums and forms: from food, crafts, art, to fashion. " Dia De Los Muertos"

				November 1st and 2nd, it is believed our departed loved ones come back and visit those still living.
				In preparation of their arrival, many prepare altars to honor them and welcome them home.
